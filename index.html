                    When two triangles have all three sides equal, they are called <b>SSS (Side-Side-Side) Congruent Triangles</b>. 
                    This means if the three sides of one triangle are the same length as the three sides of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. 
                    Congruent triangles have the same shape and size. 
                    When triangles are congruent, their matching angles are also equal. 
                    For example, if △ABC and △DEF have AB = DE, BC = EF, and AC = DF, 
                    then the triangles are congruent (△ABC ≅ △DEF), and their angles are equal: 
                    ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, and ∠C = ∠F.

                <h2>Spatial Visualization - Transparent Cube Visualization</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Spatial visualization</b> is the ability to mentally manipulate 2D and 3D shapes. 
                    It involves three key skills: <b>mental rotation</b> (imagining how objects look when turned), 
                    <b>spatial perception</b> (understanding where objects are positioned in space), and 
                    <b>spatial relationships</b> (recognizing how different parts of a shape connect to each other).
                    This skill is crucial for geometry, engineering, architecture, and 3D problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, when viewing the transparent cube in AR, you can observe how its 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices 
                    appear from different angles. Try to predict what the cube will look like from the back while viewing it from the front of  
                    this exercises your spatial visualization ability. Understanding how 3D objects appear from various perspectives 
                    helps in solving geometry problems involving volume, surface area, and cross-sections.

                <h2>Spatial Visualization - Dice Roller Visualization</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Spatial visualization</b> is the ability to mentally manipulate 2D and 3D shapes.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A standard dice is a cube with numbers 1 to 6 on its faces, where opposite faces always add up to 7 
                    (1 opposite to 6, 2 opposite to 5, 3 opposite to 4). When viewing the dice in AR, try to predict 
                    which number is on the bottom face by looking at the top face this exercises your spatial visualization ability. 
                    Understanding dice orientation helps in probability problems and games, where you need to mentally rotate 
                    the dice to figure out all possible outcomes.

                <p>
                    <b>Spatial Perception</b> is the ability to recognize differences in size, shape, distance, and depth. 
                    It involves <b>comparing and contrasting objects</b> accurately, understanding how shapes relate to each other, 
                    and recognizing patterns in geometric forms. This skill is essential for geometry, design, and real-world problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When viewing different 3D shapes in AR, you can compare their properties: a <b>cube</b> has 6 equal square faces, 
                    a <b>cylinder</b> has 2 circular faces and 1 curved surface, a <b>sphere</b> has no edges or vertices, 
                    and a <b>pyramid</b> has a polygon base with triangular faces meeting at an apex. 
                    Try to identify which shapes have more faces, edges, or vertices, this exercises your spatial perception ability. 
                    Understanding these differences helps in calculating volume, surface area, and recognizing shapes in everyday objects.

                <h2>Mental Rotation - L Shaped</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Mental Rotation</b> is the ability to mentally turn and manipulate 3D objects in the mind. 
                    It involves <b>imagining how an object would look</b> when rotated by different angles (90°, 180°, 270°) 
                    around different axes (x, y, or z). This skill is important for judging if shapes are the same or different 
                    after being rotated, and is essential for geometry, engineering, and spatial problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The L-shaped block is a classic example used to test mental rotation skills. When viewing the L-shape in AR, 
                    try to mentally rotate it by 90° and predict what it will look like this exercises your mental rotation ability. 
                    Notice that rotating an L-shape is different from reflecting (flipping) it: rotation keeps the shape's 
                    orientation (like turning a key), while reflection creates a mirror image (like seeing your reflection). 
                    Understanding this difference helps distinguish between <b>congruent shapes</b> (same after rotation) and 
                    <b>mirror images</b> (same after reflection).
